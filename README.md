# Sorting-p5.js
A visualization of 6 different sorting algorithms using the open-source JavaScript library p5.js. Created in 2024 as a senior in High School. All of the code written by me is contained within sketch.js. Created primarily as a learning opportunity for asynchronous programming in JavaScript. The basis for the implementations of each sorting algorithm is from each respective Wikipedia article.

To select a sorting algorithm, press the corresponding key on the keyboard as detailed in the text logged to the console. The "n" variable dictates how large the array is.
